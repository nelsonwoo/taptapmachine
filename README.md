# Tap Tap Machine

So here is the story.

The goal of this mobile game is to beat the record by tapping the right color of the lowest block in a stack in order to remove that block.  The top 500 players every week get a HK$10 eqv. in train ticket.

I was stucked at around 6000, and got pushed further up the next day to 9000.  Then I realized the top players were remotely human because their scores were off the chart.  They had to be bots.

I wanted that HK$10 train ticket so bad ... so I built a robot too, not the kind that ran in the Android simulator but the actual Robot!  3 robotic arms that could tap the screen buttons according to the image from the webcam.

The biggest challenge in this project is the physical property of the tapping.  The dabs of salt water will react with the metal tip that touches the screen.  The rust built up at the tip must be cleaned regularly for the tapping to be precise.

The robot was finished in 3 days, and my rank moved to 6000 on day 1, and 750 on day 2, and finally 64 on day 3.  Good enough I suppose, unless another 400 bots surface to the top again.
